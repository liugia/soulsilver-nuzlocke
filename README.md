# Pokémon Soulsilver Randomized Nuzlocke Rules
These are rules for a hardcore Pokémon Soulsilver Nuzlocke that will be completed on https://twitch.tv/liugia

<b>Start date: February 4th, 2025</b>

## General Rules
1) Can only catch the first Pokémon seen on each route/cave/town.
2) All Pokémon must have nicknames.
3) If a Pokémon faints, it is dead and no longer usable. Must release it, no exceptions.
4) No items allowed during battle, no exceptions. The only items allowed to be used during battle are held items.
5) Pokémon that level up during a gym battle cannot be used if they exceed the level limit.
6) Battle must be in Set mode.
7) No breeding allowed.
8) HM slaves are allowed but cannot be used in battle or leveled at all.
9) Once a gym has been entered, you cannot leave it until complete.
10) Pokemon will evolve early and trade stone/time-based evolutions will use stone evolutions instead (Ex. Eevee uses Sun Stone to turn into Espeon and Moon Stone to Umbreon).
11) If a Ralts or Kirlia happens to be Male on the starter select screen or in the wild (has to be first encounter in wild), the run is an instafail and you must reset the run. Same applies for Buneary and Lopunny.

<ins>Special In-world Encounters</ins>  - All in-world encounters can be caught and will not count towards your first encounter (as long as they are not dupes). \
<ins>Shiny Clause</ins> - Given that a shiny Pokémon is RANDOMLY found, you may catch it. The exception to this rule is the Lake of Rage-- the in-world shiny Gyarados counts as an encounter. \
<ins>Dupe Clause</ins>  - If the first encounter is a Pokémon that's already been caught, it can be skipped, and the next Pokémon found will be deemed the "first encounter".

## Randomization
- Starter pokemon choice is completely random. Chat decides or the weakest pokemon is chosen.
- Pokemon are randomized to be at a similar strength to route encounter.
- Trainers can have Legendaries, and important battles will always have 6 pokemon.
- All battles in this nuzlocke are considered double battles.
- TMs/HMs are completely randomized, with the exception of important TMs (like Headbutt or Dig).
